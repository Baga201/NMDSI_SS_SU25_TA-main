while fixing a sign at the retail cell phone store he owns. His
employee saw the fall and called 911 after it was clear that
Craig could not get up. He was transported to the nearest
emergency department, where he had a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scan that indicated that he had sustained a
complete fracture of the spinal cord at the C-5 level. Craig is
in good health and has no other known medical conditions.
He was placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) to await surgery

medically stable, and surgery was performed to place him
in the halo vest. He was transferred out of the ICU onto a
medical unit.

ANALYSIS OF
OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE
Craig was seen by OT immediately after the halo vest
was applied. Evaluation included observation, sensation
testing, and motor testing. No formal cognitive or perceptual
assessments were performed; however, he demonstrates
no deficits in cognition, perception, vision, or hearing on
observation and interviews. His sensation is absent distal
to C-5. In addition, he is dependent for all ADL, transfers,
and mobility. Craig has flaccid paralysis throughout his
upper extremities (UEs) and lower extremities (LEs).
Craig had been immobilized on a kinetic bed until his
halo vest was applied; he was able to tolerate supported
sitting up for 10 minutes during the evaluation, before he
began to complain of feeling nauseous and dizzy. Craig
asked to continue the evaluation at another time. During
the OT evaluation, he appeared despondent, angry, and
confused. He does not seem to understand what a complete
spinal cord injury means and is frustrated that no one will
tell him if he will walk or hug his wife again. His goal for
therapy is to do what he must to get to the rehabilitation
hospital. His expected length of stay is 2 weeks if no medical
complications arise. He is being seen by OT and PT. His
insurance is workers' compensation.
